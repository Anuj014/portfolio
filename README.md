# <h2>Portfolio</h2>

<p>I created a fully responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, experience, certifications, and projects. 
The portfolio features key sections such as About, Experience, Certificates, and Contact, along with 8 detailed project showcases, each linked to their 
respective GitHub repositories. This project highlights my proficiency in web development, responsive design, and coding best practices, offering 
a professional platform for others to explore my work.</p>
